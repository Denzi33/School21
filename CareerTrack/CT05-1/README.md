## Preamble

If your goal is not only to get an internship, but also to establish yourself for future employment with the company, then it is important for you to immerse yourself in the corporate culture and learn what the rules and regulations are. During the internship it is important to "get inside", to become a real part of the organization, which means not only to show results, but also to play by the rules of the company.

In this project we will understand how to recognize these rules and what they entail. We'll also address the issue of information cybersecurity. As an employee of the company, you have access to the data, and it is your responsibility to protect the company from information leaks and cyber attacks.

Let's start with the terminology:

**Corporate culture** is a set of norms, traditions, and values that are accepted by the members of an organization and ensure the creation of a strong competitive team united by common goals and motivations. And the rules of the company will help you adapt.

**Information security** is the comprehensive protection of information and its supporting infrastructure from all accidental or malicious influences that could result in damage to the information itself, its owners, or its supporting infrastructure. The goals of information security are to minimize damage and to predict and prevent such effects.

**Cybersecurity** is a set of methods and practices to protect computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from attackers. Cybersecurity has applications in a wide range of fields, from business to mobile technology. It can be divided into several main categories.

## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Corporate Culture / Corporate Etiquette

Why research a company's culture, understand the rules, and play by them? Doesn't that limit your freedom to be yourself?
 Following the rules of a company's culture doesn't mean you have to stop being yourself, it just makes your job easier and simpler. When you go skiing, you usually ski along the slope, not perpendicular to it.

Another definition of corporate culture is this: Corporate culture consists of sustainable patterns of behavior that have evolved in an organization and have proven effective in situations ranging from the extreme to the mundane. The main elements of corporate culture are rituals, overt and unspoken rules, office interaction rules, management model, and human communication. It's like an environment in which all employees and processes exist. It is highly visible to everyone who does business with the company: from customers to partners to candidates. Simply put, a company's culture is designed to make life as easy as possible for employees and to help them achieve their goals. Often, the rules of corporate culture correlate directly with the laws of basic politeness and etiquette.

Before you go any further, we suggest you read three books:

1. ["New Rules of Business Correspondence," by M. Ilyakhov](materials/–î–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞—è_–ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.pdf).
2. ["Rules of Business Communication. 33 dos and don'ts" by N. Zvereva](materials/–ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞_–¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ_–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è.pdf).
3. [–û. Sheveleva's "Manners for a Career"](materials/–ú–∞–Ω–µ—Ä—ã_–¥–ª—è_–∫–∞—Ä—å–µ—Ä—ã.pdf).

Let's break down how to dive in and explore each element of the culture.

You can immerse yourself in the rules of corporate culture by studying information about the company and getting to know its employees. You can listen to the speeches of the company's top executives: they often mention what exactly the company's values are and what kind of culture the company has. You can look at the company's website: sometimes there is a separate section dedicated to the company's culture. You can also talk to the company's employees, for example, you can ask your HR department about the main principles of the company's culture.

### Appearance

_Coco Chanel once said: "You will not have a second chance to make a first impression"._

What is important about an employee's appearance?
 Shoes, clothes, well groomed skin, nails, hair.

It's also important to match your appearance to the company you're in.

Watch the movie "The Intern", pay attention to what the employees of the company are wearing and how the main character is dressed. Your appearance says more about you than you'd like to think. An unkempt appearance may suggest that you don't really value yourself or your work. Can people trust you? This is important not only for offline meetings, but also for online ones. One of the ways you demonstrate self-respect is through your appearance. If you respect yourself, your manager and colleagues will respect your hard work and contributions.

### Working hours

Time is one of our most precious resources. We should value our working hours, project deadlines, vacations, and so on. All these concepts are your working tools. Working hours are an important condition of employment, so clarify the company's working hours at the interview stage.

First, you'll need to learn the company's practices:

- When does the work day start and end?
- Do people often work overtime and stay late? Is overtime and weekend work paid?
- How do you approach the topic of vacation? Who do you need to talk to about scheduling?

### Workspace ‚Äî toilet/coffee/dining area

At work, we don't just work.

Every human being has certain physiological needs. At work, we eat, we go to the bathroom, someone smokes, and so on. There are breaks from work, and you can spend them in some way: you can go for a walk or spend time in the recreation area. You can ask all these questions to the HR manager who will support your employment. In addition, all these questions can be an opportunity to get to know and communicate with your colleagues.
 Learn from your coworkers:

- Where the bathroom is;
- Where you can get coffee, if it is the company's policy for employees to bring their own coffee and something to eat with it, if the company buys tea/coffee and sweets/breads, etc.
- Where the cafeteria is located;
- Where the recreation area/gym is located, if any;

Your workplace:

- Where your workstation will be;
- How to make a pass;
- Where to get equipment;
- How to formalize access to the systems;
- How to formalize remote access if you'll be working in hybrid/remote mode.

Find out if the company has open areas where you can work, such as a coffee shop.

## Rules of communication

The next big block is dedicated to communication. You don't work alone, you work in a team, and it is very important to establish communication in such a way that colleagues would want to talk to you and help you. We recommend you to go through these books:

1. ["New Rules of Business Correspondence," by M. Ilyakhov](materials/–î–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞—è_–ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.pdf).
2. ["Rules of Business Communication. 33 dos and don'ts" by N. Zvereva](materials/–ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–∞_–¥–µ–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ_–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è.pdf).
3. [–û. Sheveleva's "Manners for a Career"](materials/–ú–∞–Ω–µ—Ä—ã_–¥–ª—è_–∫–∞—Ä—å–µ—Ä—ã.pdf).

**Conversations**
No matter who you are talking to, you need to get to know them first. Do not hesitate to ask your colleague's name again and ask a few casual questions: how long has he/she been with the company, what does he/she do, etc. Don't forget to introduce yourself, tell them who you are and what you are doing. It's important to say hello if you haven't seen the person that day, and goodbye if the day is ending. Address people by name.

**Corporate email**
Find out what electronic communication tools, such as email clients/services and calendars, employees are using.

**Messengers**
Find out which messengers your colleagues use. Find out if you can install a desktop version of a messenger on your laptop or on your computer.

**Calendar - meetings /vacations**
Find out in which application the meetings are posted. Find out how to accept or decline a meeting and how to reply. Find out which meetings are offline and which are online.

**Offline meetings**
 Determine the exact location of the meeting. Check with colleagues beforehand to find out exactly where the meeting room is. Arrive early to a meeting: Being late also gives the impression that you are not committed.

**Online meetings**
 Make sure you have the right software installed to connect to an online meeting and that your camera and microphone are working. It's important to have meetings with your camera on, especially at the beginning of your job/internship. It's important for people to get to know you and remember you.

**Vacation/breaks**
You haven't even started working and we're already talking about your vacation. Vacation is an important part of work, and it is true that it is worth thinking about in advance. You are a part of the operating system. You do your part of the job. Your colleagues are counting on you. Therefore, announce in advance that you plan to go on vacation, even if you have an unpaid internship, let alone a job. Notify your colleagues in advance and set your email to auto-respond for the duration of your vacation. If you don't know how to do this, Google it or ask your colleagues for help. Do not make the mistake of having a mis-set auto-responder send emails under your name all over the company.

## Safety culture

Security is something that must not be violated!
 The loss of corporate data or the intrusion of cyber threats into corporate systems can result in criminal liability. Forewarned is forearmed! We're not talking about intentional leaks here. First, it's important to prevent accidental leaks.

**The simplest things:** sending information via messenger, using a flash drive, or opening an external website from a work computer can result in data loss or leave the system vulnerable to a cyberattack. Please don't let your guard down.

An inadvertent leak, despite the lack of goals and prepared actions, can cause tangible damage to an organization. It can tarnish an organization's reputation, expose trade secrets, or provide important information to competitors. The biggest danger is that an incident is usually discovered after a period of time, preventing remediation and damage control.

Inadvertent leakage is a situation in which information is unintentionally disclosed to a person or persons not originally authorized to have it. It most often occurs during monotonous work when, due to employee fatigue or negligence, information is received or transmitted to third parties through an unprotected communication channel or using removable media. In all such cases, there is a violation of security policies.

Typical examples of unintentional information leakage include

- Entering an incorrect email address when sending/forwarding emails;
- Sending data to the wrong recipient via messenger or social media;
- Using open file sharing, cloud services, open access documents to store sensitive data;
- Leaving an unattended computer with sensitive data on it;
- Using removable media and then losing or transferring data to a home computer.

**The main channels of inadvertent leakage:**

1. Mobile devices.
Today, most of our personal information is stored on a smartphone or cell phone. Personal information such as full name, photo, bank card may be associated with the device. In addition, there may be passwords and logins to websites, social networks, online stores, and files that a person uses at work. The loss or theft of a mobile device can be costly to the owner.

2. E-mail, messengers.
Lack of attention and excessive workload can lead to sending documents to the wrong recipient. There is also the possibility of being redirected by a phishing link or installing malware, which can lead to data leakage.

3. File sharing services.
Many large companies use various cloud services for convenience, allowing them to access information quickly and store large amounts of data. Incorrect configuration of file access rights, server errors, transfer of links over an insecure channel all contribute to uncontrolled third-party access to this data.

## Chapter IV
## Exercise 00
### Before starting an internship/job

You have already selected several positions in Project01 that match your values and priorities. Now you need to learn more about the company and prepare for the internship.

1. Explore 3 sources of information about a company's culture and answer a few questions:

- How do employees dress? Is there a dress code?
- What should you wear on the first day to fit in with the company culture?
- How will you know what time to arrive and what time to leave?
- What else do you need to know about the workplace and working hours? Write 5 points.

2. Make a list of questions you couldn't find answers to that you will ask on the first day.

## Exercise 01
### Your first day

Now imagine it's your first day on the job at the company. You need to write a cover letter to introduce yourself to the team.

1. Write a letter to your coworkers introducing yourself. Think about the structure of the letter: who you are, what your name is, and what job you'll be doing. Think about what facts will be useful to your colleagues. At the end, it's great to add the phrase "I look forward to being of service to the company and to you.
2. Many companies will ask you to include a photo. Think carefully and include a photo that best represents you to the team.
