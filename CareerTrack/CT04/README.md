## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Why understand the methodology if I'm just here to code?

Let's imagine your first days in the company. You have joined a team of developers, there are a lot of unfamiliar people and new words around, there are meetings scheduled in the calendar, and as a possible result you may experience a lack of understanding of how everything works in this company at the initial stage.

The sooner you understand how the team is organized, what the rules are, and how the process of working on tasks is organized, the better you will fit into the team and the workflow.

You will also have an additional factor for rapid growth, and you will be able to actively participate in the life of the team and suggest improvements.

*Example:* A team has been working successfully for a long time. It has been using one of the methodologies. A developer who didn't know it and didn't want to get involved joined the team. Out of a great desire to prove himself, he/she:
* Starts inventing and immediately implementing new features in addition to his tasks, which may not be needed by the customer; 
* Stops going to team meetings because he/she doesn't understand why he/she is there; 
* Tries to implement all the functionality all at once, instead of taking it one step at a time and breaking it down into smaller tasks.

Since each team member is dependent on the others, actions such as those described above can result in missed deadlines and lost money.

Therefore, to avoid such incidents, for each product/project development the team is working on, a specific methodology is selected that will most effectively lead the team to a successful outcome.
A methodology is a set of approaches, practices, and development models.

There are 2 major types of project management: Traditional and Agile.

1. The **traditional approach** is used when we already know exactly what product we want to get, and each next stage starts only after the previous one is completed. The most common application of this type of method can be found in the construction and medical fields.  
An example of this approach is the Waterfall (cascade) model and the V-shaped model.

2. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditional approach, **Agile Methodologies** began to emerge and were combined into a single Agile philosophy — a set of 4 values and 12 development principles.

In what areas of your life or current work are you already applying Agile values? To answer this question, read the Agile Manifesto.

The most popular Agile approaches among IT professionals are Scrum and Kanban. Let's take a closer look at them.

Note that the cornerstone of Agile is **communication and interaction both within the team and with users**.  
For many people, this may be new: "Why should I tell the whole team about my tasks?", "Why should I analyze and tell everyone about my bugs?", "Why do we need these meetings?".  
Such actions help teams to organize themselves and produce a high quality product that the market needs.

## Scrum Framework. What to be prepared for?
Scrum is a way of organizing work that is particularly popular with IT teams. It's very likely that you'll be working within this framework.

The basic unit of Scrum is a self-organized and cross-functional team, which means that:

- All decisions are made with everyone's input;
- The team decides who does what, how and when;
- The team has all the necessary skills to achieve the goal.

Scrum is suitable for teams involved in product development. It is suitable when there is only a product idea, but no understanding of how to approach it, or there is a business goal, but no certainty of what will lead to it, or when no one can provide clear development plans. Scrum allows you to gradually overcome uncertainty by moving into **small iterations and constantly testing**: Are we doing what our customers need? Does our work add value?

SCRUM explicitly regulates the values, the distribution of roles, the organization of events (meetings) and the artifacts used during the workflow. These rules of thumb are described in the Scrum Guide.

![SCRUM](misc/images/CT04.01.png) 

Let's take a closer look at the Scrum Retrospective tool. This meeting is needed to reflect on the work done by all participants in order to plan quality or efficiency improvements. You will conduct it as part of your current project. The algorithm for running a retrospective consists of 5 steps:

1. Set the stage;
2. Gather data;
3. Generate insights;
4. Decide what to do;
5. Close the retrospective.

## Use of the Kanban method. How to apply it in real life?
The Kanban method can be applied to any process you're involved in and make it more agile: at work, at school, and in your personal life. It's an evolutionary approach, which means you don't have to rebuild your team or implement everything at once to use it. You can start applying the practices gradually. 

The essence of applying the Kanban method is to see how the current work process is organized and then improve that process, making useful changes and correcting ineffective ones.

Kanban provides 6 core practices.  
Let's analyze one of them:  
*Visualize.* All of our work needs to be visualized. This allows us to see our entire current process, understand patterns of performance, and suggest opportunities for improvement. It is often the case that if a task isn't written on the board, it probably won't get done. You should also visualize the rules by which the team operates. For example, visualization will help you see and organize the large flow of incoming requests and inquiries in one place.

Read more about these and [other practices](materials/Канбан.pdf).

The teams using Kanban often have a Service Delivery Manager. This person is responsible for managing the flow of tasks in the Kanban system (he/she doesn't hand out tasks manually) and removing obstacles in the flow. He/she monitors the team's metrics and helps the team plan improvements.

## Formal and informal rules of teamwork. What are they for?

You come into the team and find out how it works and what the formal rules are.

For example, almost all teams have **task trackers** that help make SCRUM or Kanban methods practical. One of the most popular task management services is Jira (it was named after the Japanese monster Godzilla, which was a play on the name of the competing product Bugzilla), because it allows you to easily implement any of these frameworks, using graphs and reports to monitor the flow of tasks and the performance of teams. There is also a large set of plugins that you can add to extend this tool. For example, the following is an example of how the School 21 team uses Jira for the SCRUM framework.

This is what the board looks like, showing all the tasks that are in the sprint and that we need to accomplish the sprint goal:

![Jira](misc/images/CT04.03.png) 

And below is an example of a product backlog, based on which the product owner can assign goals and tasks to sprints in advance.

![бэклога](misc/images/CT04.04.png) 

Such a tool allows you to:

- See the whole work process;
- Focus on the goal of the sprint;
- Be part of a self-organizing team;
- Keep track of where the team is falling behind and where there are challenges to overcome.

Implementing the Kanban method in a task tracker will help to apply several practices. What practices do you think you could use if you were part of a Kanban team running a task tracker?

In addition to Jira, there are of course many other useful online task boards. For example:

- Trello;
- Asana;
- Kaiten;
- Yandex.Tracker, etc.

Also, one of the formal rules of teamwork can be to maintain a corporate knowledge base. As the team works on the project, they gain new knowledge about its implementation, make mistakes, new arrangements, and so on. This knowledge is kept in one place for preservation and training of new employees. Teams often use Confluence to create team rooms and upload articles, documents, and attachments. 

Don't be afraid to speak up, ask questions, and suggest changes! Good luck in your new job!

## Chapter IV
## Task 1

You need to spend the next week on the development team using common practices like working with a task board and attending retrospectives. Once you try them for yourself, you'll understand why they're necessary. You'll also get a deeper understanding of how SCRUM is applied and take the test.

**Note!**
You cannot complete Project 04 until you have completed individual Projects 05 and 06. If you complete Project 04, you won't be able to complete the following projects.

![SCRUM](misc/images/CT04.02.png) 

## Chapter V
## Exercise 00
### Create and maintain a team board with learning objectives
1. Create a board on any convenient platform for the entire team.
2. Place all the tasks of the third block on this board and keep them updated. (Project 04, Project 05, Project 06). All team members must maintain them. Tasks can be related not only to specific assignments, but also to the study of relevant supplemental materials.
3. Make sure that everyone can follow the link and see the task board.

## Exercise 01
### Conducting a Team Retrospective

1. After all participants have completed the day's tasks (Project 05, Project 06), a retrospective must be held using the online board (Miro, Metroretro, Trello, etc.) according to the 5 stages of the meeting.
2. Each team member should practice the role of facilitator and participant. The meeting facilitator needs to prepare in advance. They need to plan each step, choose the exercise and the tool. Try to use different tools at each meeting so that you don't repeat yourself and test all the options.
3. One of the team meetings should be recorded and uploaded. You should record the entire retrospective process and demonstrate all 5 steps.

The retrospective videos and links to the boards should be uploaded. They need to be clickable so that people can click on them and see the results of the discussions.

## Exercise 02
### Passing the SCRUM Assessments
1. Each participant is required to take a [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) comprehension quiz.
2. The test result must be higher than 70%. The screenshot with the result must be attached. For better preparation you can study the latest version of the [Scrum Guide](materials/Scrum_Guide.pdf) (available for download in the materials -> Scrum-Guide folder). You will find all the answers there.
