## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Result management

The result of your work is what you get when you complete certain actions or activities, a result that shows your current level of professional development and growth. The result of your work also shows how you benefit and contribute to the development of the company.

In order to evaluate and record the status of whether the internship/training period has been successfully completed or not, and whether you are successfully immersed in the workflow, it is necessary to set a correct and measurable goal at the initial stage.

For example, the result you need to achieve by the end of the internship or the result you need to achieve by the end of the trial period within the workflow. The more clarity you have about what you need to do, when and how, the more relaxed and confident you will feel about your work.

Results management begins the moment the outcome is defined. How will you know the result has been achieved?

**Set a goal and define the outcome**
  
No one but you is responsible for completing your work, including the moment you receive the assignment and define the format of the result. If you don't understand what the manager wants from you, it is your duty to ask enough questions to make it clear and understandable.

For example:
Your manager has asked you to complete a project. But what exactly does that mean? Doing a project may mean one thing to you and another to your manager. Let's look at a clear example of how a manager might set a task.  
Manager 1: I will promote you if you complete all tasks on time and with high quality.  
Manager 2: I'll promote you if all 5 projects you're working on are completed and launched on time within the next 3 months.

You will probably be more motivated to negotiate a promotion with your second manager if you are given clear and defined deadlines and expected results. The same principle applies to setting goals in your daily work. If you do not understand the goal, it is your duty to make every effort to clarify it.

**The First Goals**

Your first result is the result of your probation/internship:

1. What exactly you need to learn, what systems you need to master;
2. What projects to complete;
3. Who to meet with.

Initiate a meeting with the manager to set goals for the probationary period (SMART).

Set goals with your manager for the **first week, first month, and first three months on the job**. Setting goals and creating a plan will bring certainty and clarity to your daily work.

**Daily work and results**

If you don't think through your goals and results, you won't be successful in your daily tasks. If you don't want to be disappointed with your work and your manager's evaluation, remember that taking on a task is just as important as doing it well. You can't have one without the other.

One of the easiest ways to make sure you have what it takes to accomplish a task is to use the SMART Goal Setting technique.

**SMART Goals in Goal Setting**
 
SMART is a way of describing goals. It was developed by George T. Doran in the 80's, but hasn't lost its relevance. The method establishes criteria for effective goal setting. The goal should be:

- **S**pecific: The goal should be specific and clear: not "gather task requirements", but "meet with four key project customers and input product requirements into the ToR".
- **M**easurable: The wording should be quantitative. This will help to evaluate the outcome and provide a benchmark. Example: not "meet with everyone", but "meet with the three key people on the project".
- **A**chievable: Check that you have the resources to accomplish the task. It's your responsibility to alert your manager if you know you won't be able to do it in time. Or, if the workload is too great, ask how you can test tasks.
- **R**elevant: Check the relevance and coherence of tasks and their alignment with the company's global goals. You can ask questions about why it's important to do this task and what larger task their task is a part of. Employees often worry that they don't see the big picture. If it's important to you to see the big picture of the company's mission and purpose, think about what you can do to learn about it.
- **T**ime-bound: Work goes faster when there is a time frame: you can spread the load and prioritize. Not "quickly or urgently," but "by October 10th" or "by noon tomorrow".

You can read more about how to set SMART goals [here](https://www.cfin.ru/management/people/dev_val/soft-skills.shtml). The article is written for managers, but we recommend it for all employees. After reading it, you'll be much more aware of how the task is set up and be able to immediately see areas that need clarification.

## Communicating with the Manager

People say: "You come to the company, but you leave the boss".  
So that you don't leave either the company or the manager, and so that your work satisfies both you and the manager, let's find out what your influence is in building relationships with the manager. Where's your share of the responsibility?

Well, a manager is the person on whom you depend: whether you will grow, whether you will have access to the most interesting tasks, whether you will be able to work. Or, for example, whether the manager will control you, how interested he/she is in your development (if at all). All these factors depend not only on the manager, but also on you.

First, let's figure out what the right relationship between a manager and an employee is. Relationships are a complex and complicated concept. Proper relationships allow people to trust, support, and understand each other. There is no fear of talking about difficulties and problems, and you are able to speak boldly about successes. It means there is proper communication between people. There is a simple recipe for building this dialogue and making the relationship comfortable for both parties.

Your calendar and your manager's calendar should include time for you to talk about your performance and ask questions.

Most importantly, you and your manager should have a regular one-on-one time, such as once a week, for at least 15 minutes. Why?

- To share what you've accomplished during the week. Even if progress is minimal, it's important to share results regularly.
- You'll get task adjustments and your manager's opinion.
- You'll get feedback on all issues.
- You can talk about motivation and discuss the difficulties that arise.
- It's also a time to talk about going on vacation or wanting a promotion.

Your goal for the first 1-3 months is to set up a regular (once a week) one-on-one meeting with your manager. Even if the manager doesn't think it's necessary, insist on it: you need it to adjust.

## If something doesn't work out

_There are times when it's hard to reach an agreement or you and your supervisor disagree on something. What to do?_

The first step is to talk directly with your manager. Then, if you don't know how to structure the conversation or don't have someone to consult with about how best to have the conversation, you can always talk to a HR representative. You should not discuss the difficulty of dealing with your supervisor with your coworkers.

**Feedback**

For newcomers, feedback is an important development tool. You must not only expect it from your manager and co-workers, but also ask for it. What can feedback teach you about yourself? Typically, companies focus on performance and quality of work, personal and professional growth, teamwork, and achieving results. Looking at these aspects from other people's points of view will help you organize your work more effectively.

Even when people think they are objectively evaluating their actions, they still have blind spots. Because of them, we may perceive feedback as unfair and get angry. Instead, it is better to understand the reasons for such feedback and discuss them with the manager. You may simply be unaware of a negative trait in yourself.

## Communication with Coworkers/Peers

You spend 40 hours a week, sometimes more, with your coworkers. How those hours are spent determines both productivity and enjoyment. Therefore, it is important to strive to make these relationships as effective as possible from the start.

Several studies confirm that having close friends at work, or at least having good team relationships, is one of the key factors in determining whether we are satisfied with our jobs. A good working relationship with colleagues looks like this

- It helps the team work effectively through mutual respect and open communication;
- It helps newcomers adapt quickly;
- It has a positive effect on mood, motivation and work productivity;
- It saves time and effort: instead of scheming and fighting for survival, you grow professionally.

### What are established relationships with colleagues?

You may feel comfortable if coworkers just smile and say hello when you meet them. For some people, it is important to have a friendly relationship with colleagues, to have coffee together all week and cocktails on Fridays, to know that you can share personal problems and get advice.

Relationships with colleagues, the quality and warmth of communication will depend on you ‚Äî on your openness and willingness to communicate, to show empathy and support, to turn a neutral or friendly connection with strangers into a warm and friendly one.
