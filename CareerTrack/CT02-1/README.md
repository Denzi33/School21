## Chapter I

![Project illustration](misc/images/Illustration_02.jpeg)

## Preamble

A resume showcases you, your skills, and your experience.
 Remember that you are not writing a resume for yourself, but for an employer. Imagine that you're an employer reading your resume. Before you send a reply, think about whether you would like to invite such a candidate for an interview.

A resume consists of several sections:

1. Position and contact information;
2. Experience description;
3. Skills description;
4. "About me" section;
5. Other information.

In this project, you'll learn how to:

- Create a current resume and use it for future reference;
- Write a cover letter;
- Define financial expectations.

## Chapter II
## General Rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is normal. Remember that the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you just see it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. You'll only be cheating yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and to what end. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Position and Contact Information

Contact information is the first thing a recruiter will see. You might think there's no room for error. But let's compare the two versions:

|   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John Smith <br /> [kittycat@gmail.com](mailto:kittycat@gmail.com) <br /> Phone: 18002752273 | **OR** | John Smith<br />[john\_smith@gmail.com](mailto:john_smith@gmail.com)<br /> Phone: 1-800-275-2273<br />Telegram: @john\_smith |

Which contacts do you think look more professional?

Basic tips for designing this block:

1. **Provide your last name and first name.**
Patronymic in a digital environment is not necessary to specify, exceptions can be made only if you are planning to go to public sector/banks.

2. **Your e-mail!** No kotletka@, princesska@, kotik@.
Let's save these emails for other occasions. The correct way to name your email is lastname_name@... For example, malikova_julia, malikovaj, etc.

3. The **phone number** must work and preferably be the only one that can be reached.

4. **Write your Telegram username** (make sure you've changed it from @kotik to something more professional).
 Many recruiters now use Telegram for initial communication with candidates, which is very convenient. You can also schedule an interview there.

5. **Insert a link to your portfolio (optional).**

## Skills

Describe your skills according to the position you are applying for. How will you know what skills to include?

**You need to go back to the table with your job analysis.**
 Look again at the jobs you liked and chose. Next, write down the most common skills in the description and relate them to your experience.

There are many [examples](https://myresume.ru/examples/it-specialist/). List the skills in order of priority based on your level of knowledge and experience. And, of course, don't exaggerate your skills. If you haven't worked with some components or just don't have the experience, it's better not to list them.

## Experience Description

Ground rules:

1. Work experience on a resume is always listed from last job to first job.
2. Your work experience should always include your duties and results. Every potential employer wants to see your accomplishments.
 The main question an employer asks when looking at your resume is: "How were you useful to your previous employer?"
3. Go back to analyzing job postings and look at the requirements and responsibilities listed in them. This is your most important resume writing tip.

What is important to include in your work experience?

1. The name of the company;
2. Period(s) of employment;
3. Position held;
4. Duties;
5. Results.

**1. Company Name**
 If you've worked for a large company, there's a good chance that every hiring manager knows about it, and such a resume adds weight to the experience.
 If you've worked for a lesser-known company, it's a good idea to include what makes this company different, what the company specializes in. This information can usually be found on the company's website. Perhaps the company is a leader in some industry and works with large clients (Sber, Yandex, etc.). All these facts can be included in a resume.

**2. Period(s) of employment**

- Indicate only months and years. You don't need to write the exact dates when you were hired and when you left the job. You don't have to list how many months you worked for companies on your resume.  
 *For example: March 2018 â€” April 2020 is enough.  
 If you are employed at the time of your job search, you can list it this way: March 2018 â€” present.

- Always list your experience from your most recent (current) position to your first position. If you have interruptions in your work experience, list them like this: three to four months at each job. You can combine them into one project activity/freelance.

- You can leave out some jobs and tell the interviewer that you have been searching and interviewing. A standard job search can take 3 to 6 months. In the future, try to stay in one job for a year and a half, because people who change jobs frequently are considered unreliable by recruiters.

**3. Position**
State the position you held. Preferably, your job title and your desired position should be the same.

**4. Objectives** 
 Questions to help you describe your past experience:

1. How did I add value to the company?
2. How does my work impact company/department goals?
3. How can my work be digitized?
4. What metrics have improved during my tenure?
5. What are my strengths? To answer this question, look at the SWOT analysis assignment.
6. Have I saved company resources?
7. What do I do best in my job?
8. Did I have an impact on improving a department/company process?

It's important to write exactly what you did and what the challenges were. It is not recommended to copy and paste job descriptions: no one reads them.

**Sample job description:** 

_Job Responsibilities._ The analyst performs the following duties:

1. Organizes analytical support of scientific and methodological work in the course of implementation of the program of experimental work.
2. Interacts with the deputy director of scientific and methodological work and methodologist.
3. Carries out analytical work for collection, evaluation and analysis of received information.
4. Participates in the organization of scientific and practical conferences, seminars, round tables and other forms of dissemination of experience on the subject of the implemented project of experimental work.
5. Provides advisory and practical assistance to the staff of the institution in the areas of experimental work within their competence.

On the other hand, in a resume, you write the result of your performance in a job, for example:

1. Developed a data quality analysis tool using ML and static methods. The tool allowed the client to save up to 60 man/hours per month.
2. Redesigned the accounting text classification model. The new model is 15% faster and 6% better on the f1 metric.

**5. Results**
 This is the most important part of the resume. The hiring companies are always interested in the results you have achieved, so it is advisable to digitize them. Verbs to help you describe your accomplishments:

- I improved...
- I reduced...
- I optimized...
- I developed...

**Work experience without experience.** What to write?
The most common question is: "What to put on a resume if you have no experience?"

1. Internships or practicums from School 21.
2. Freelance projects that you can and should include in your portfolio.
3. Learning projects that you have completed as part of your School 21 education can also be included in your portfolio.
4. Participate in an intelligent volunteer project. Apply for a project and if selected, complete the assignment and add it to your portfolio. (ProCharity)
5. Professional projects. Programmers can participate in [open source projects](https://tproger.ru/articles/open-source-for-beginners/).
6. Experience in case championships and hackathons.

## "About me" section

What should you write in the "About me" section?

1. First and foremost, list your strengths that are important to the position you are applying for.
 Even if you lack relevant experience, you can still find strengths. This is most often the case with "soft skills". Always use your past experience to explain why you think a particular skill is your strength. Refer back to the last Project Exercise 2, where you completed a strengths and weaknesses analysis.

2. Write about your desire and ambition to develop in a new area. Tell people why you want to develop, what brought you to this field, etc. You can also include a link to your portfolio/website/professional blog.

_Tip #1_

1. In this section, you can state your purpose. Write about why you love what you do and what inspires you.
2. Include your qualities that are unrelated to the position, such as your athletic accomplishments.
3. List your soft skills.
 Make sure you don't say things like: stress-resistant, proactive, communicative, etc. When you identify these skills, go back to your past experiences. Ask yourself, "Why do I have leadership skills?" Maybe you were a project leader when you were a student? What made you stress resistant?

## Where to Write a Resume?

1. Create a resume on hh.ru.
2. Use resume builders, such as BuduJobs, Icanchoose, Grintern, Novoresume, MyResume.ru.
3. Use ready-made templates on Canva.
4. Format your resume in Word (and save it as a PDF).
5. Create a resume in Word, save it to Google Drive, and send a link to your resume. (Don't forget to open access.)
6. Create a resume in Notion.

_Tip #1. Create two resumes: One on HH.ru and the second in any builder._ 
HH.ru is a starting point for your job search. You can use a different resume for other career sites or when looking for a job in telegram channels.

_Tip #2. Not more than 2 pages, preferably one._  
 The standard resume is 2 pages. You should put the most important information on the first page. But remember, it doesn't matter how many pages your resume has, what matters is that your resume is interesting.

The School 21 PIN team has prepared a resume checklist for you, as well as a resume template in Figma (Materials -> Instructions for creating a resume).

## Typical mistakes when making a resume

| Mistake | How to fix it |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Lack of achievement in your work experience | Outline not only your responsibilities, but also state your KPIs. For example:<br/> - was one of the top 3 students in the course;<br/> - Served as a mentor to 5+ fellow students, assisted in mastering the curriculum;<br/> - completed 30+ learning projects.<br/> KPIs are measurable indicators of your performance. This data shows your effectiveness, and that's what the employer is interested in. |
| 2. Incorrect level of foreign language proficiency is indicated | Be honest and specify the one you currently have. Beginner; Elementary level; Pre-Intermediate; Intermediate; Upper Intermediate; Advanced; Mastery/proficiency. |
| 3. Spelling mistakes in a resume | Ask your friend/teacher/mentor to check your resume or use this [website](https://glvrd.ru/). |
| 4. Incorrect salary expectations | Research the salary market in your industry and in your region. |
| 5. Indication of non-core experience | Take it off your resume if it doesn't fit the desired position. |
| 6. The resume is too long (3 or more pages) | Eliminate the unnecessary: the resume should be informative and concise. Two pages at most! |

## Cover letter

Why and when do I need a cover letter?

1. A cover letter is needed if the job description requires it.
 If this paragraph is there, it is better not to neglect it and fulfill the condition.
2. If you're changing fields, it's imperative to write about your new motivation in your cover letter.
3. If you are a young professional and just starting your career.
4. If there is no vacancy in the company itself, but you really want to work there.

You need to answer two questions in your cover letter:

1. Why does the company need you?
2. Why do you need the company?

Answer the question, "What is it that attracts you? Why do you want to work there?" Show your motivation.

**Step 1.** Analyze the company/job/project.

- Tasks of the desired position (problems, priorities);
- Candidate requirements;
- Company mission;
- Values;
- The qualities that a particular company values.

**Step 2.** Answer the questions:

- What do I know about the organization?
- What motivates me for this position?
- How is this position a logical extension of my career?
- What can I do to solve a specific problem?
- What skills, knowledge, accomplishments do I have that qualify me for this position?

**Step 3.** Write a cover letter using the following structure:

1. A brief greeting (if you know the hiring manager's name, use it in your greeting).
2. Tell me what position you're applying for if you're sending a resume to an employer's work email. It's better to state exactly where you saw the job posting.
3. Interest in the job/company/project (answer the question, "Why are you interested in this company?")
4. Strengths according to the desired position (Answer the question, "Why should this company be interested in you?")
5. Again, remind everyone of your motivation. For example: I would like to be considered for this position.
6. Include your contact information.

Example of a [Cover Letter](Materials/Cover_Letter.pdf). (available for download in the Materials folder -> Cover_Letter)

## How do you discuss salary?

Try to stay on top of the salary analysis market. You can always look at your job analysis file.  
 There's a lot of information in open sources about the average salary range for professionals.

_Useful Salary Analytics Resources:_

1. Zarplatomer (SuperJob -\> Zarplatomer);
2. Salary Survey (CAUS - Salary Survey);
3. Recruitment agencies that perform salary analysis (RealHR).

In order to negotiate salary, whether it's at the recruitment stage or when discussing a raise, it's important to understand how much your work is worth in the market:

- Prepare for the question, "Why should we raise your salary?" It is important that you show results and that your hard work is making a difference in the company. Then prepare a small progress report. What have you been doing? What did you accomplish? How was *something*/how is it now? What has improved as a result of your work/what indicators have increased/decreased due to what/what resources?
- See the job analysis for yourself. You've done job analysis on a previous project. This is also your guide for salary negotiations.  
 If most of your skills match the positions you want, that's a good reason to talk to the manager about a raise.

## Chapter IV
