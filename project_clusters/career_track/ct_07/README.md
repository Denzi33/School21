## Preamble

When we talk about career planning, this question seems too complicated. How do you plan when the world outside your window changes every day? How do you plan a career? You'll learn how to plan when the world is changing. How do you move toward your goal? What do you do to see opportunities within the organization? At what point do you let your manager know you want to grow?

Key competencies for career advancement: What competencies are needed for career growth? Understand the difference between a person who sees opportunities and a person who sees limitations, and how to reframe thinking. You'll learn how to develop the most important competencies: opportunity awareness and self-presentation.

## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III

## How to plan a career

How do you plan when the world outside changes every day? What if you plan something and can't get it done? Or you invest time in development and still don't achieve your goals. Do we need to plan at all?

Absolutely, **yes**. Having a goal to strive for changes a lot in your life:

- You won't just work, but you'll notice the progress, your personal growth, and how you're moving toward your goal;
- You'll find it easier to make decisions in your daily life. For example, if you have to choose which task to focus on more, understanding where you're going will help you make decisions in your daily life;
- Those who have purpose are less likely to burn out. Watch a video of Viktor Frankl, the founder of logotherapy, a very famous branch of existential psychology. The essence of his main idea is that having a purpose makes you willing to work harder and more accepting of situations when things go wrong. Less burnout, higher performance, easier to deal with difficulties.
- When you have a goal, you're more motivated and less likely to procrastinate. If you've become lazy and find yourself lacking energy and motivation, make sure you have a goal.

Remember that you planned your 5-year career goal in Project 00, which was based on your desires and plans. After you've been working for a while, your career goal may change and you'll have more conditions to analyze. You will need to learn an expanded career goal chart that you can return to throughout your career.

![Expanded career goal](misc/images/CT07.01.png)

1. Begin by defining Point A, the point of the here and now. Think about your present career status. Be honest about your current situation. Even if you're not happy about something, write it as it is.
2. Point B is your goal one year from now. Think about what you want to accomplish by that time.
3. Point C ‚Äî goal in 5 years (strategic goal). What position can you grow into? What directions are available to you at this time. Keep in mind that most people tend to overestimate their opportunities in the short term, like a week or two, and underestimate them in the long term, like a year/five/ten years. There is another limitation to keep in mind. Most of the time, people are more afraid of their strengths than their weaknesses, so it's okay to be afraid to dream big.
4. How do you get to a goal? Development tools are anything you use to gain new knowledge, develop skills, or change behavior/thinking. It can be training, online or offline courses, internships, mentoring or coaching.
    - Check with your manager or HR representative to find out what resources and opportunities for growth, development and training are available at your company.
    - Find out from HR if the company offers to pay for outside training for the employee and under what conditions.
    - Find out if the company has a mentoring and coaching program, if there are external and/or internal coaches.
    - Find out if there are other ways to help you achieve your goals.
    - Find out what development tools the company has, and choose the ones that will best help you achieve your goal (points B and C).

## When to talk to your manager about the fact that growth is important to you

Every company has its own rules about growth and development. You can ask HR about these rules, opportunities and restrictions.

When do you need to talk to your manager about the fact that growth is important to you? The answer is simple: the sooner the better. If you just walk into an internship, meet your supervisor, and immediately talk about your growth plan, you can immediately bring up what you need to do to grow, what you need to look for, and what the most important outcome is for your supervisor. You can do an internship just for the sake of it, or you can set a goal to grow and get access to the most interesting work ‚Äî it's not hard to figure out which approach is more effective. As a result, the manager will have a completely different attitude towards you.

## Key competencies for career growth

When it comes to career development, there are two key competencies that will help you grow in addition to performing well and delivering results. These are the two competencies of Seeing Opportunities and Presenting Yourself Effectively.

**Competency 1: Seeing Opportunities**

What is the difference between the mindset of a person who grows, develops, gets a new position, and the mindset of a person who doesn't grow? We all live under certain constraints, most of the time we lack time, money, people, knowledge, experience. Let's look at some examples.

_Example #1_: The manager is unable to give you a new position. No vacancy, no budget, etc. Right now, you can bump into this limitation and do nothing. You can complain about the inadequacies of the company's processes, or you can start looking at the situation from a different angle.

For example, you look at where you want to go (to point C) and you look at what skills and competencies you need. You start to develop and see opportunities for growth, while promotion to a new position is not possible for you at the moment. You learn what else to study, who to go to for mentoring or guidance, what skills to develop on the job, and who else to meet. The power of opportunity lies in understanding what cross-functional area you need to master.

You don't need to focus on limitations; you need to focus on what is possible for you in a given situation.

_Example #2_: I can't plan my career because I don't know if I can and will get a new position next year, so I won't do anything. Why should I try if the result is not guaranteed?

Or

I don't know if I'll get a job next year, but I can definitely set a goal with my manager again and identify the key competencies I need to develop. And even if I don't get a job, I'll be more professional, more confident, and more opportunities will come my way.

This is the mindset of opportunity.

**Competency 2: Presenting Your Results**

The ability to notice and talk about your daily results. If no one but you knows how well you're doing, what your results are, and that you're growing and doing more challenging tasks, what you have to overcome, and how you're doing, no one will guess. You can talk about your results in team meetings or in regular meetings with your manager.

Gone are the days when simply doing a good job was enough to advance your career. If you want to grow, it's important to be able to see and talk about the results of your work.
