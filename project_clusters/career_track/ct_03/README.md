## Chapter II
## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III
## Preparing for the interview
### What does it mean to prepare for an interview?

What kind of interview there might be:

- Phone (usually a quick call to invite you back for another interview);
- Skype/zoom interview — online interview;
- At the company's office — offline interview.

There are some important steps to take before you go for an interview:

1. Read about the company and the position you've been invited to interview for.
2. Look up information and read articles about the hiring manager (if you know him/her), look through his/her articles to get a rough picture of the person.
3. Rehearse a story about yourself and your major accomplishments at home.
4. Get your clothes ready.
5. Get a good night's sleep and come to the interview in a good mood.

Let's look at two types of interviews:

### Online Interview

This is now one of the most popular types of interviews.
 Here are some basic rules for preparation:

- **Appearance counts.** Of course, you should dress neatly, just as you would for an offline interview. Of course, the online dress code is more relaxed. The main rule is to find a decent top: shirt, sweatshirt, dress. Please don't wear a housecoat, tank top, stained T-shirt, etc. First, it doesn't give you confidence in the interview, and second, it distracts the recruiter and triggers internal judgments.
- **Your background.** If you have astrological forecasts and birth charts hanging behind you, the interviewer may be distracted by them, so it is better to keep the background neutral and not colorful so as not to distract from the interview.
- **Technical Equipment.** Before the interview, check that everything is working and have extra equipment on hand in case of unforeseen circumstances. If you have trouble connecting or your computer freezes unexpectedly, quickly switch to your phone. Also check your headphones so that both you and your interviewer can hear everything.
- **Quiet place.** Try to remove any extra background noise. Of course, sometimes it's impossible to predict whether your neighbor is fixing something or not. Nevertheless, try to take care of everything in advance.
- **Not a time for a snack.** Don't eat during the interview. Even if you eat an apple during an interview, it's still distracting.

### Offline Interview

Office interviews are less common these days, but some companies still hold them regularly.
 Here are some ground rules:

- **Appearance counts.** You don't have to wear a classic suit, there are definitely no strict rules these days. What is important is that you look clean and neat.
- **Plan your route.** Plan your route to the office in advance. Study a map and find out where the office is so you won't be late.
- **Give yourself plenty of warning.** Sure, there are acts of God, but they rarely happen a minute before the interview. So plan ahead and try to arrive on time.
- **Silent mode.** Turn off your phone so you won't be distracted during the interview.

Remember, you're not the only one being interviewed for a job, but you're choosing your dream job. So pay attention to how the interview is conducted, what questions are asked, and what the office environment is like.

### Frequently asked questions by the company

The best way to ace an interview is to prepare for it. Here is a list of the most frequently asked questions.

Experience:

1. HR will ask detailed questions about your experience that are relevant to the position.
2. Tell us about your projects that didn't work out and what you learned from them.
3. If you've changed jobs a lot (working 3-4 months at a time), you'll be asked "Why did you change jobs so much?"
4. If you are employed at the time of the interview, you better expect the question "Why do you want to leave your company?"
5. If you're not employed at the time of the interview, the hiring manager may ask, "Why did you leave the company?"

About you as a person:

1. An interviewer may say: "List your strongest competencies. Why did you name these particular skills?"
2. If you're changing careers/fields, you're bound to be asked, "Why are you moving to a new field? What motivates you?"
3. What do you enjoy doing?
4. What do you dislike about your job?
5. What skills would you like to improve?

About teamwork:

1. Please give me an example of a conflicting work situation. How did you resolve it?
2. Have you managed people? How did you lead the team?
3. What qualities do you like and value in people?
4. What qualities are important to you in a leader?
5. What kind of person would you not be able to work with?

About the company:

1. Why would you like to join our company?
2. What made you interested in the company/job?
3. What do you know or have heard about the company?

This is just a sample list and you should always be prepared for these questions.

### Questions for the company

At the end of an interview, HR often asks: "What questions do you have for us?" If your answer is "I don't have any questions," that's not a good thing: HR may feel that the candidate is not highly motivated to work with them. So always have a few questions ready that are important to you.

A few sample questions:

1. How is the KPI of an employee's performance measured?
2. What are my career opportunities?
3. Why is the position open?
4. What are my goals for the next six months?
5. How is the process of bringing a new person on board organized?
6. Can you tell me about your company culture?
7. What is a typical day for an employee?

## Thinking ahead
### Career Goals

Interviewers often ask job candidates about their career goals. Keep your real goals in mind. Look at your Project 01. If you are clear about your goals, the employer will appreciate it because he/she will understand your motivation. Understanding the career goal also reflects the candidate's responsibility.

So think ahead about how the dream job will help you achieve your career goal in 1-2 and 3-5 years.
 The more thoughtful your answer, the better your chances of being considered for the position.

### Salary Questions

Almost every candidate is afraid to talk about salary in an interview. Consider the following phrases: _"I'm afraid to talk about salary because what if I ask for too much and get rejected?"_ This reflects low self-esteem.

_"I'm ashamed to talk about money"_ — this is a common behavioral pattern among Russians who remember Soviet life, when it was inappropriate to talk openly about money, a person just worked and earned the salary that the company assigned.

_"I don't know how much money to ask for"_ — it indicates ignorance of how to value one's work, devaluation of one's work, and/or lack of market knowledge.

_"I don't like asking for money, I feel like a beggar!"_ — it reflects insecurity.

Each of these fears needs to be worked with so that it doesn't affect your income level.

**What is the solution to all these challenges?** Try to stay on top of the salary analysis market. You can always Google what the average salary range is for professionals:

1. There are useful resources that publish salary analysis (Zarlatometer, Salary Survey, Labor, etc.).
2. You can look at the reports of recruitment agencies that do salary analysis, such as Hays or Antal.

**Why do you need to know your salary range?** To negotiate your salary both at the time of hiring and when discussing a raise.

1. Just knowing your salary range is not enough. You can't go to your manager and say: "It says here that the average salary for a mid-level software test engineer is $1500." Most likely he or she will say something like: "So what?" And if you don't have the right answer, you won't get what you want.
2. Prepare for the question, "Why should an employer raise your salary?" What matters here is that you show results and that your hard work in the company makes a difference/money. Then prepare a small progress report. What have you been doing? What did you accomplish? How was *something*/how is it now? What has improved as a result of your work/what indicators have increased/decreased due to what/what resources? If you don't have answers to questions like these, you're back to being stuck with the paycheck you had.
3. Look for yourself at the job analysis you did in Project02.
4. Self-esteem and insecurity are very complex and deep issues. You can look at the psychological literature, or you can work with a psychologist or a coach. Both of these professionals work with these issues and help you find a solution.

Ideal preparation consists of: studying market research + your own analysis + your results.

When can you talk about pay?

1. When you start a new job.
2. When you can talk about a promotion in your current job.

If you are asked about your salary at your first job interview, you can say: "I'd like to discuss all my duties/objectives first, then I'll be able to estimate the cost of my work." Discuss the real numbers based on the actual duties with the hiring manager.

You can shift the responsibility to the hiring manager and ask: "Can you tell me what salary range you are currently offering candidates? I need to know whether or not I'm going to consider the offer." Of course, the HR manager may give you an answer like: "Well, it depends on the experience of the candidate." Then you can go back to the previous advice and say that you are willing to discuss it after you understand what the candidate's responsibilities and goals are.

Once you have decided on a salary range, you need to research the market and look at salary surveys. Typically, candidates will leave their previous job for a new one with at least a 10-15% increase in salary (of course, you should look at the responsibilities and relevance of their experience).
 If you are changing direction/field, the salary may be lower. But it's important to know the range for a new field as well, even if you're going for a junior position.

**Negotiation strategies**

1. Never start an online or offline interview with the question: "So how much do you pay? What's the salary like?"
2. Talk first about goals, objectives, what KPIs need to be met.
3. Prepare an answer to the question: Why are you considering this area? (You need to give arguments about the results of your past work, what you did, what results you achieved).

**How to estimate the real cost of your work:**

1. Talk to HR, go for an interview.
2. Study market analysis.
3. Do your own market research.

**Let's summarize:**

1. Deal with your fears and work through them so they don't affect your income level.
2. Study salary analysis.
3. Talk about salary from the perspective of your results.

### Uncomfortable and Inappropriate Questions

Unfortunately, HR or your hiring manager may not always be tactful in their questions. Here are some typical questions that can be off-putting:

"Are you planning a pregnancy?"
 "Why don't you have a husband/wife?"
 "How much does your husband/wife make?"
 "What does your wife/husband think about your career goals?"
 "What is your zodiac sign?"
 There may also be questions about religious beliefs, political views, etc.

What to do in these situations and how to respond to an employer's question?

1. Ask the employer why these questions are important to him or her and how they relate to the job you are applying for.
2. If the employer insists on asking these questions, end the interview if you're uncomfortable.
3. When faced with such questions, you must choose between sharing the company's culture and answering the question, or realizing that this company is not the right fit for you.
4. Sometimes these odd questions are asked to see how a candidate behaves in a stressful situation. Stress interviews used to be popular. These interviews are rare now, but you may come across them.
5. Try to turn an answer to these questions into an appropriate joke.

## Self-presentation
### You need to be able to present yourself and speak intelligently about yourself and show your value

Talking about yourself often seems difficult for the candidate. Yet, it is usually the very first question asked by the hiring manager or HR. How do you answer it? You need to have a structure and prepare your answer.

**You don't have to memorize a story about yourself.** When you're nervous, you can get confused and lose focus, so it's better to keep the plan in your head, in a notebook, or on your phone.

**A plan for telling a story about yourself:** 

1. Who are you? — What you do for a living, how many years you've been doing it.
2. Where did you go to college, what's your educational background?
3. What have you done in your career for the last 5-7 years? — Give a brief summary of your goals and accomplishments.
4. Where do you work now and what are you responsible for? — Tell the interviewer more about your current responsibilities and results.
5. Your career goals and motivation.

[Example of a story about yourself](materials/Пример_рассказа_о_себе.pdf)

### What not to talk about in an interview

During the interview process it is strongly discouraged:

- Talk about your personal problems in the first interview.
- Ask the first questions about salary.
- Judge a previous employer (even if you parted on bad terms).
- Ask inappropriate questions about employees.
- Bring up matters of religion and politics.
