## Preamble

We can divide the job search into several stages:

1. Planning;
2. Market analysis;
3. CV (resume) writing;
4. Getting responses;
5. Going to the interviews;
6. Failure analysis;
7. Feedback collection;
8. Offer acceptance.

But before you start searching for your dream job and the right company for you, you need to think about your future career trajectory. This is the stage where your professional journey and your further development begins. In this lesson, you'll learn all the steps you need to take before writing a CV (resume).

In this project, you'll learn how to:
- define your values;
- set goals and plan your career.

By working on this project, you will learn:
- how to articulate your career values which directly influence your choice of future company and vacancy;
- how to set and specify goals that will help you build a career trajectory.

## Chapter II

## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III

## The wheel of career priorities

If you don't understand what you want out of your job, the search can drag on for a very long time. Doing this exercise will help you understand what to rely on when choosing a company and job opening. When you have a clear understanding, you'll be able to navigate the job market and choose a dream job.

Your job search starts with setting your goal and planning. Before looking for a job, you can do a career wheel with your job selection criteria:

![Колеса карьерных приоритетов](misc/images/CT00.1.png)

**What could those criteria be?**
- ability to work remotely;
- desired salary range;
- health insurance/social benefits;
- friendly team etc.

The criteria must be determined by you and you only. You need to rate (on a 10-point scale) where each criterion stands now and what you are working towards.

_Why do it?_ To see what career you're aiming for, what you want to improve, and what steps to take to achieve those goals. Setting your priorities will help you create your resume, pick companies and go through interviews later in your career. Employers pay special attention to and recognize those candidates who know exactly what they want. When you're going to choose between several job offers, you can always address your priorities and make the right choice.

## Setting career goal

Career goal setting helps to decompose your global goal and accelerate your progress towards it. It's possible to have a goal that sounds like "I want to become a lead programmer", but if you don't understand how to achieve it and don't break it down into steps and analyze what you need to do to reach it, such a goal becomes meaningless. There are different goal-setting techniques. You can apply them not only in your career, but simply in your life as well.

There are many different career planning and goal setting techniques that you can use, for example:

**GROW by John Whitmore:**

- **Goal** - What's your goal? What are you trying to accomplish?
- **Reality** – What's your current situation?
- **Options** - What are your options for accomplishing the goal? Who can help you? What do you want? You need to brainstorm some ideas.
- **Will** - What do you need to do to accomplish the goal? What are the next steps? When would you take them?

For example:

| Goal | Reality | Options | Will |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To become a CTO in a startup in 5 years and earn 4,000 - 4,500 USD. | Now I'm a student at School 21. I know JS and use React library. I have a relatively small student portfolio. | \- Complete the training to the end.<br /> \- Get a job first in a large company to work with a mentor/manager so I can learn from experience<br /> \- Possibly receive additional training in team management<br /> \- Constantly improve my skills<br /> \- Build a portfolio<br /> \- Solve algorithms | 1. Complete the training<br /> 2. Create a resume and prepare a portfolio<br /> 3. Successfully pass an interview and get a job<br /> 4. Work in a team of developers for the first 2-3 years, be initiative and become a team leader<br /> 5. Become a head of the department in 4-5 years, leave for the startup and become CTO |

**SMART**

After deciding on the goal, you need to define your values. Each person has different values that change throughout their life journey. Thus, we can emphasize the following values:

- Autonomy
- Work-life balance
- Income
- Security
- Innovation (doing innovative projects)
- New impressions (trips, new projects)
- Teamwork
- Society/Ecology (being wholesome and sustainable)
- Self-expression/Creativity, etc.

Read more about ["Smart"](https://in-scale.ru/blog/celi-smart/)

Understanding your values will help you decide on a list of companies that are the best fit for you and that you will aspire to.

You can take a [personal values assessment test](https://onlinetestpad.com/ru/test/74311-test-cennosti-shvarca)

We advise you to break the career goal down into two periods to have a clear understanding of your career path and direction:

1. The first point of reference "A" is today.
2. The second point "B" is your career goal for 5 years ahead.
 Planning a career beyond 5 years is difficult because the world is changing rapidly now, some professions are dying out and others are being automated, so it's important to follow your direction, develop your skills and stay on track.
3. The intermediate point between "A" and "B" is 2-3 years.

| Today (point A) | 2-3 years | Career goal (point B)<br />5 years |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At this point, you describe:<br /> \- Your current career status<br /> \- Skills and knowledge you possess<br /> \- Resources available for development | You will fill in this column later, after completing exercises on job analytics and identifying your strengths. Then you will need to write down the action plan that you will be ready to implement to achieve your career goal. | Describe the desired position that you want to take up in 5 years, for example:<br />*CTO in an educational startup working remotely with a team of 4-5 developers and a salary of 4,500 USD with benefits*.<br />For each period, you can use the SMART or GROW methodology. |

You can draw the final career plan in MIRO. This platform provides a handy way to break up time periods and add necessary updates to your individual career track. It is preferable to develop a step-by-step career plan that maps out:

1. Skills you currently possess;
2. Skills that you lack to achieve a career goal;
3. Decisions on how to acquire certain skills (find a mentor, take a course, get peer review, etc.);
4. Break down your career plan to think out 2-3 and 4-5 years ahead. Don't forget to check in with your career progression every year.

## Chapter IV

## Task

To accomplish this task, you need to map out your career track for the next 3-5 years. To do this, you need to understand your career goals, define your values and create a step-by-step plan.

## Chapter V

## Exercise 00

### The wheel of career balance

1. Write out at least five job selection criteria and rate on a scale of 1 to 10 the status of these criteria now.
2. Make a second wheel with the same criteria and rate them again from 1 to 10 to show what you would like these criteria to be in the future.
3. For each criterion, come up with and write down the action steps to show what you'll do to achieve the desired state. We recommend you to complete this exercise in MIRO. Please upload a visualization of the final wheel (2 pcs) to the _src_ folder.

## Exercise 01

### Career goals

1. Make a spreadsheet of your career goal for 1-2 years and 4-5 years.
2. In the first column, describe your current career status.
3. In the third column, write down what career goals you are striving for in 5 years and what is important to you in your job. Your answers should be based on your values and your career balance wheel.
4. Leave the second column blank for now.
