"""Process functions

This module is used to perform the calculations necessary to calculate replicants.

This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following
functions:

    * check_respiration - returns determination to replicant respiration
    * check_heart_rate - returns determination to replicant heart rate
    * check_blushing_level - returns determination to replicant blushin level
    * check_pupillary_dilation - returns determination to replicant pupillary
    * make_decision - returns binary value of replicant determination
    * main - the main function of the script
