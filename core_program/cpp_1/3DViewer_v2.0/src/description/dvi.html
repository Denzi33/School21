    <h2>Project Description: 3DViewer v2.0</h2>

    <p>3DViewer v2.0 is an advanced software program designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization
      experience for 3D wireframe models. Built using C++17 standard, the program adopts object-oriented programming
      principles and adheres to Google coding style guidelines. It is aimed at enabling users to load, manipulate, and
      analyze 3D wireframe models with precision and ease.</p>

    <h3>Key Features and Capabilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Model Manipulation:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Translation: Users can translate the model along the X, Y, and Z axes by providing a specific distance.</li>
        <li>Rotation: Models can be rotated around their X, Y, and Z axes by specifying the desired angle of rotation.
        </li>
        <li>Scaling: The program allows users to scale the model uniformly by a given factor.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Model Selection: A button to select the model file and a display field to showcase the model's name.</li>
        <li>Visualization Area: An interactive area where the wireframe model is visually represented.</li>
        <li>Transformation Controls: Intuitive buttons and input fields for translation, rotation, and scaling
          operations.</li>
        <li>Model Information: Displays essential information about the loaded model, including its file name, number of
          vertices, and edges.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Performance: 3DViewer v2.0 has been meticulously optimized to handle wireframe models of varying complexities.
        Users can view models with vertex counts ranging from 100 to 1,000,000 without experiencing interface freezes
        (defined as inactivity exceeding 0.5 seconds).</li>
      <li>Design Patterns: The project incorporates three distinct design patterns, such as facade, strategy, and
        command, to enhance code structure and maintainability.</li>
      <li>MVC Pattern: The program strictly follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The model encapsulates the core functionality and data processing logic.</li>
        <li>The view is responsible for rendering the GUI and visual components.</li>
        <li>The controller handles user interactions and orchestrates communication between the model and the view.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Namespace and Libraries: All classes are organized within the s21 namespace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bonus Features:</h3>

    <h4>Part 2: Settings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Projection Type: Choose between parallel and central projection.</li>
      <li>Edge Appearance: Customize edge type (solid or dashed), color, and thickness.</li>
      <li>Vertex Display: Set the method of vertex display (none, circle, square), along with color and size
        adjustments.</li>
      <li>Background Color: Personalize the background color of the visualization area.</li>
      <li>Persistent Settings: All user-defined settings are saved and restored upon program restart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Part 3: Record</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Image Capture: Users can save rendered images as BMP and JPEG files.</li>
      <li>Screencast Recording: A dedicated button enables users to create short GIF animations, capturing the ongoing
        custom affine transformations. These screencasts are of 640x480 resolution, at 10 frames per second, with a
        duration of 5 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3DViewer v2.0 represents a sophisticated and user-centric solution for professionals and enthusiasts engaged in
      3D model analysis, manipulation, and visualization. With its robust features, adherence to coding standards, and
      dedication to optimal performance, the program sets a new benchmark in the realm of 3D wireframe model
      visualization tools.</p>
