## Chapter I

### Foreword

* There are two words in English that are commonly confused: ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù ‚Äúand
effectiveness‚Äù.
* To highlight the difference, let us tell you a short joke.
* My motto is ‚ÄúEfficiency. Efficiency. Efficiency.‚Äù Oops. I guess I only need to say it once
* Or as Peter Drucker once said: ‚ÄúEfficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is
doing the right things‚Äù
* Your code should not only be effective, but efficient as well. And vice versa
* One of the best games for learning how to be efficient is Factorio. Google it.

Download it. And try to get back to MODULE 4 Not everyone will be able to.

## Chapter II

### Instructions

* Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to any rumors or speculations
about how to prepare your solution.
* Here and further on we use Python 3 as the only correct version of Python.
* The python files for python exercises (module01, module02, module03) must have
the following block in the end: ```if __name__ == ‚Äò__main__‚Äô```.
* Pay attention to the permissions of your files and directories.
* To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
* Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
* You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified
by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your .gitignore to
avoid any accidents.
* When you need to get precise output in your programs, it is forbidden to display a
precalculated output instead of performing the exercise correctly.
* Have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. If that fails, try your neighbor
on the left.
* Your reference material: peers / Internet / Google.
* You can ask questions in Slack.
* Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise spec-
ified in the subject.
* And may the Force be with you!

## Chapter III

### Specific instructions for the day

* No code in the global scope. Use functions!
* Each file must end with a function call in a condition similar to:
    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # your tests and your error handling
    ```
  
* Any exception not caught will invalidate the work, even in the event of an error
that you were asked to test.
* No imports are allowed, except those explicitly mentioned in the section ‚ÄúAutho-
rized functions‚Äù of the title block of each exercise.
* You can use any built-in function if it is not prohibited in the exercise.

## Chapter IV

### Exercise 00 : List comprehensions

Exercise 00

List comprehensions

Turn-in directory : ex00/

Files to turn in : benchmark.py

Allowed functions : import timeit

Imagine that your task is to get all the Gmail addresses from a list of email addresses
from the list that are Gmails. The usual approach is to create a loop, and iterating from
the initial list append the required values to a new list.

But that can be inefficient if we are talking about large amounts of data. There is a
more efficient and pythonic way to do the task ‚Äì list comprehensions.

In this exercise, you need to:

* write two functions:
  * in the first you need to implement the usual approach with a loop and an
  append
  * in the second you use a list comprehension instead
* use timeit to measure the time required to run those functions 90, 000, 000 times
and compare them
* put this into a script that prints ‚Äúit is better to use a list comprehension‚Äù if the
corresponding time is less or equal than that of the loop, and ‚Äúit is better to use a
loop‚Äù if not,
* also, add the time values at the end, after the print described above. Order them
from shortest to longest.

Please, use the following list of email addresses: 
```
emails = [‚Äôjohn@gmail.com‚Äô, ‚Äôjames@gmail.com‚Äô, ‚Äôalice@yahoo.com‚Äô, 
‚Äôanna@live.com‚Äô, ‚Äôphilipp@gmail.com‚Äô]
```

Duplicate the values 5 times. As a result, the list will contain 25 elements, but only 5 unique
ones.

An example of the script being launched:

```
$ ./benchmark.py
it is better to use a list comprehension
55.71611063099999 vs 58.849982983
```

## Chapter V

### Exercise 01 : Map

Exercise 01

Map

Turn-in directory : ex01/

Files to turn in : benchmark.py

Allowed functions : import timeit

Ok, chances are that you saw the difference: list comprehensions are slightly more
efficient than loops and more readable as well. But that is not the only option available.

There is also map()!

Map comes from functional programming. You do not have to iterate through a list.

You can apply a function to an iterable. That is what you are going to do in this exercise!

Modify the script from the previous exercise:

* Write a function that does the same thing: creates a list with Gmail addresses
taken from the initial list of emails (25 elements), but using a map. Try map() and
list(map()). Note the difference in speed
* You still need to compare which function is faster, but now you have three options:
loop, list comprehension, and map, and add one more phrase according to this in
your code ‚Äúit is better to use a map‚Äù and at the end, you need to display all three
time values with the same condition: they should be in the ascending order by
length.

The example:
```
$ ./benchmark.py
it is better to use a map
29.32016281 vs 54.620376492999995 vs 55.99120069
```

Check the results of all the functions. Are they all identical? They do not have to be.

## Chapter VI

### Exercise 02 : Filter

Exercise 02

Filter

Turn-in directory : ex02/

Files to turn in : benchmark.py

Allowed functions : import timeit, import sys

* Did you notice that what you did in the previous exercises was filtering? Why
not use the corresponding function filter() instead of those list comprehensions and
maps? It works almost the same as map(). You will love it!
* Add a new function to your benchmark that uses filter(). But this time let us
refactor the code. Let us create a script that takes the name of the function (loop,
list comprehension, map, filter) to your benchmark and the number of calls it should
perform for the benchmark. In return, it should give the time spent to make that
number of calls of the function.

The examples:
```
$ ./benchmark.py loop 10000000
6.230267604
$ ./benchmark.py list_comprehension 10000000
6.214286791
$ ./benchmark.py map 10000000
3.063598874
$ ./benchmark.py
```

## Chapter VII

### Exercise 03 : Reduce

Exercise 03

Reduce

Turn-in directory : ex03/

Files to turn in : benchmark.py

Allowed functions : import timeit, import sys, from functools import reduce

Besides map() and filter() there is another function that might be useful for you in
the future ‚Äì reduce(). You can also use it instead of loops and, in most cases, it will be
more efficient when you need to calculate a sum. In this exercise, you need to calculate
the sum of squares up to the number given as an argument. For example, if 5 was given,
the sum will be ```1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55```

In your script create two functions:

* in the first ‚Äì you need to implement the usual approach with a loop and ```sum = sum + i*i```
* in the second ‚Äì you use a reduce() instead

* Let us create a script that takes as an argument the name of the function (loop or
reduce), the number of calls it should perform for the benchmark, and the number for
the sum of the calculation of squares. In return, it should give the time spent to make
that number of calls of the function.

The example:
```
$ ./benchmark.py loop 10000000 5
6.230267604
$ ./benchmark.py reduce 10000000 5
3.063598874
```

## Chapter VIII

### Exercise 04 : Counter

Exercise 04

Counter

Turn-in directory : ex04/

Files to turn in : benchmark.py

Allowed functions : import timeit, import random, from collections import
Counter

‚ÄúKnow the built-in functions‚Äù is one of the most vital commandments for a Python
coder. Here we are going to use the collections module that is shipped with Python.
It contains a number of container data types - we will use Counter. It is very handy,
for example, when you need to count unique values in a list. And it is faster than any
function that you can write by yourself. But don‚Äôt take our word for it, check it out for
yourself!

* generate a list with 1 000 000 random values from 0 to 100 (remember list compre-
hensions?)
* write a function that creates a dict out of the list where the keys are the numbers
from 0 to 100 and the values are their counts
* write a function that returns the top 10 most common numbers where the keys are
the numbers and the values are the counts, the input is the list
* solve 2 and 3 using Counter
* make a comparison: your script should display the time spent for 2 and 3 with
Counter and without it

Example:
```
$ ./benchmark.py
my function: 0.4501532
Counter: 0.0432341
my top: 0.1032348
Counter's top: 0.017573
```

## Chapter IX

### Exercise 05 : Generator

Exercise 05

Generator

Turn-in directory : ex05/

Files to turn in : ordinary.py, generator.py

Allowed functions : import sys, import resource for Windows: import sys, import os, import
psutil

Code efficiency is not only about the time spent, but also about the RAM used. This
is quite important if you work with big data. Or maybe smaller-scale data can also cause
you trouble? You have already got used to making experiments. Let us do yet another
one.

* Download the [MovieLens dataset](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip).
* Unzip it. You will need the file ratings.csv (678.3 MB is not that big, right?).
* Create the first script, ordinary.py. It should have only one function: it reads all
the file lines into a list and then returns it. In the main program, write a loop that
iterates through the list and calls pass. You should give the path to the file as an
argument to the script
* Create the second script, generator.py. It does exactly the same thing, but in your
function, you must use a generator. It uses the keyword yield to read one line at a
time and returns it to the caller. In the main program, write a loop that iterates
through the generator and calls pass. You should give the path to the file as an
argument to the script.
* Both scripts should display Peak memory usage in GB and User mode time +
System mode time in seconds. If you have Windows OS, use the corresponding
functions to get the same metrics.

Example:
```
$ ./ordinary.py ratings.csv
Peak Memory Usage = 2.114 GB
User Mode Time + System Mode Time = 5.77s
$ ./generator.py ratings.csv
Peak Memory Usage = 0.005 GB
User Mode Time + System Mode Time = 9.04s
```
