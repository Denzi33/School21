* 1Ô∏è‚É£ s21_matrix+ - 100/100 % (300 xp)
  * Description: in this project, you will implement the matrix library that you already know from the s21_matrix project, but this time you will be using the object-oriented approach. The object-oriented approach allows to implement a library for matrices as a separate class whose objects have defined operations;
  * Tasks: implementation of the s21_matrix_oop.h library functions;
  * Skills: OOP - 105, C++ - 105, Types and data structures - 90;
  * Weaknesses: >>> ;
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ s21_containers - 143/143 % (501 xp)
  * Description: as part of the project you need to write your own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes: list, map, queue, set, stack and vector. Implementations should provide a full set of standard methods and attributes for element handling, container capacity checking and iteration;
  * Tasks: implementation of the s21_containers.h library, implementation of the s21_containersplus.h library, implementation of the insert_many method;
  * Skills: Types and data structures - 200, C++ - 125, Leadership - 100, OOP - 125, Team work - 50;
  * Weaknesses: all;
* 3Ô∏è‚É£ SmartCalc_v2.0 - 125/125 % (750 xp)
  * Description: in this project you‚Äôll need to implement an extended version of the standard calculator in C++. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, you need to supplement the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.);
  * Tasks: implementation of SmartCalc v2.0, credit calculator, deposit calculator;
  * Skills: C++ - 300, OOP - 225, Types and data structures - 75, Algorithms - 150;
  * Weaknesses: all;
* 4Ô∏è‚É£ 3DViewer_v2.0 - 140/140 % (1050 xp)
  * Description: in this project you‚Äôll need to implement an application for viewing 3D wireframe models in C++ in the object-oriented programming paradigm, implementing the same functions as the previously developed application in 3DViewer v1.0 project;
  * Tasks: 3DViewer v2.0, settings, record;
  * Skills: OOP - 420, Algorithms - 210, Graphics - 53, C++ - 263, Team work - 150, Leadership - 210;
  * Weaknesses: all;
* 5Ô∏è‚É£ 3DViewer_v2.1 - 142/142 % (852 xp)
  * Description: in this project you‚Äôll need to modify the application developed in the 3D Viewer v2.0 project. The new version should render a three-dimensional object not only in a wireframe form, but also with surface shading;
  * Tasks: 3DViewer v2.1, settings, record, texturing;
  * Skills: Algorithms - 256, OOP - 170, Team work - 85, Graphics - 170, C++ - 170, Leadership - 170;
  * Weaknesses: all;
* 6Ô∏è‚É£ 3DViewer_v2.2 - 142/143 % (1136 xp)
  * Description: in this project you‚Äôll need to modify the application developed in the 3D Viewer v2.1 project. The new version should render a three-dimensional scene using ray tracing;
  * Tasks: 3DViewer v2.2, settings, optimization;
  * Skills: Algorithms - 342, OOP - 113, C++ - 227, Graphics - 341, Team work - 113, Leadership - 227;
