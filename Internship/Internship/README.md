***Postscriptum:***

You suddenly woke up to what sounded like the banging of a door:

*"Rise and shine, come on! Today's the big day, you can't sleep through the start of your internship"*, a familiar voice came from somewhere near your ear.

You struggled to keep your eyes open, your head reached for the pillow, the blanket wrapped around you, but your brain was already starting to wake up and the room was modeling itself. You replayed the events of the dream in your mind, which were surprisingly long and clear. Unfortunately, the longer you thought about it, the more it blurred. Some AI and a megacorporation, rebellious developers. It didn't add up, even if it seemed colorful.

*"Get up, you sleepyhead!"* came from the other room. You got out of bed and took the first step into your future...

### Introduction

Finally, your long and thorny journey through the Core Program has come to its logical conclusion in the form of a full-fledged internship, which you will be completing for three months in a real company, for which we congratulate you most sincerely! We hope that you have learned many new and valuable things during your time in the "Core" and that you have made interesting acquaintances :) 

At this point, you already have a certain amount of knowledge and experience, which can be further consolidated and tested in action on real tasks. It is okay if you feel that you are not ready or that your knowledge is not enough. After all, the entire internship project is exactly the same educational stage as all the projects before it, which will help you learn many new things: to get an inside look at the industry, to try your hand at the inner kitchen of the IT sphere outside of school projects. 

It will also help you decide in which direction you want to grow and what you want to do with your career: get into back-end development, work with real-time, high-load systems, build and manage corporate networks, or even start your own IT startup.

There are *3* major stages to this project:

1. Find and choose a company and a job;
2. Apply for and complete an internship;
3. Write a report on the results of your internship.

You will also have to pass *2* levels of evaluation of your internship: one by your curator (or mentor) at the company, and another by your peers, who will listen carefully to your internship report. So be sure to take your report as seriously as possible so that each peer reviewing you can understand what you did and what you worked on during your internship.

## Chapter II

### Part 0. Vacancy Search and Selection

Before starting the project, you must choose a company and an internship position. Your choice of position is subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
- The duration of the internship is **3** months.
- Employment must be **at least 20 hours per week** (*part-time*).
- The company should provide a *curator* or *advisor* (*mentor*) who will accompany you throughout the internship, give you feedback, and actually evaluate your work. If the company does not have a full-fledged internship program, discuss with your supervisor who you can consider as your mentor - yourself, a senior colleague from your department, or even a product manager (although this is highly undesirable).
- The position should correspond to one of the specialties from this [list](https://21-school.ru/specialties).

Note that there is a possibility of getting a job as a junior developer or higher if all the above internship criteria are met.

As a report at this stage, it is necessary to prepare a small markdown file *src/search.md* in the *develop* branch with a description of the chosen position, the requirements for it, and a description of the company where the internship will take place.

### Part 1. The Internship

Once you have selected a position that meets all the requirements, you will need to sign an internship agreement or contract with the company of your choice. And don't forget to upload a letter of employment to Applicant, as past internships cannot be validated! Note that the dates in the document must cover the dates of the internship as a project. 

The next 3 months will be full of exciting real-world tasks and hard work, so good luck! And may the power of Verter be with you. :)

### Part 2. Write a report on the results of your internship

Within 3 months, you must prepare a report in presentation format that tells a story about the company, your position and duties, including the tasks you performed during the internship. Be sure to include the following information in your report:

1. A short story about the company, what kind of projects they do, what kind of culture they have.

2. A brief history of your position in the company. What functional unit/department did you work in? What were your daily responsibilities?

3. A brief history of the structure of the project team or functional unit in which you interned, as well as the accepted methodology for organizing project work, the processes and tools used.

4. A description of the tasks you performed (with examples of your favorite and least favorite tasks), what you did during your internship, and the project(s) you worked on. As a brief analysis of your work, also provide statistics on the tasks assigned to you: their total number, the number of tasks successfully completed, the number of tasks returned in progress, and the average time spent on the task. Indicate what skills/qualities you have acquired and what skills/qualities you have used during the internship (not only technical ones!), with examples of situations.

5. The results of the internship. What did you achieve? What did you contribute directly to the company and the project(s) you worked on?

When writing the report, be sure to consult with your curator or mentor about what can and cannot be made public â€” some details of the organization's structure or project activities may be considered confidential. If so, try to summarize your story without going into details or specifics.

Also remember that your speech and presentation will be heard by other colleagues who may not know anything about the company or your work. Therefore, your main task is to structure your presentation and story in such a way that absolutely everyone in the audience can understand what you did there. Your final grade will depend on your ability to explain what you did to your peers.

The total length of your presentation must be **between 5 and 7 minutes**. So try to be detailed, but to the point. And be sure to prepare your text ahead of time so you don't waste time improvising.

The presentation should be uploaded to the repository in the *src* folder (*develop* branch) with the filename *internship_pres*.

The report should be prepared during the internship and uploaded to the platform before the mentor gives you the second grade.
